# Face-Recognition-System-using-Machine-Learning

Face recognition is a simple application which detect and recognise the faces in the real time video.

1. Initially a file named "Dataset" has to be created where the three program files(Dataset creator, trainer and detector) are located.

2. During execution of DatasetCreator.py, facial dataset is creatd and captured images will be stored inside the creted dataset file.

3. After creating dataset, trainer.py train our model.

4.  Finally, detector.py program detects the faces present in the video scenes. If trained images are present, then it displays the name of the person. If not found, it will display "Unknown".
